  - Implement all typography, color palette, spacing, and grid as per spec
  - Set up CSS variables for theme colors
  - Integrate 8-point grid system
  - Add all button, input, card, and UI component styles
- [ ] **UI/UX Consistency**
  - Apply Apple-inspired minimalism and visual hierarchy
  - Ensure all components use correct font stacks and scale
- [ ] **Authentication**
  - Integrate NextAuth.js v5 with Google OAuth
  - Secure session management
  - Add sign-in/sign-out flows
- [ ] **Landing Page**
  - Pixel-perfect layout with headline, subtitle, CTA
  - Subtle fade-in animation
  - Responsive and accessible
- [ ] **Accessibility Baseline**
  - Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, alt text for images
  - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
  - Color contrast checks
- [ ] **Initial Bug Analysis**
  - Lint codebase and fix all TypeScript/ESLint errors
  - Test all flows for UI/UX bugs (e.g., misaligned elements, missing focus states)

### Exit Criteria
- All UI matches design spec
- Authentication works end-to-end
- No critical or visible UI/UX bugs
- All accessibility checks pass

## Phase 2: Core Functionality & Integrations

### Objectives
- Implement document upload, processing, chat, and AI integrations.
- Ensure robust backend and data flow.

### Tasks
- [ ] **File Upload**
  - Integrate UploadThing with 10MB limit and progress tracking
  - Drag & drop and file browser support
  - Success/error feedback (green/red states)
- [ ] **Database Integration**
  - Connect to MongoDB Atlas
  - Implement User, PDFDocument, and ChatSession schemas
  - Ensure user data isolation and secure queries
- [ ] **PDF Processing Pipeline**
  - Use pdf-parse for text extraction, fallback to Tesseract.js for OCR
  - Intelligent chunking (semantic, 50-token overlap, no mid-sentence breaks)
  - Preprocessing: remove headers/footers, normalize whitespace, extract tables
- [ ] **AI & Vector DB Integration**
  - Integrate Google Gemini Pro API for embeddings and chat
  - Store embeddings in Pinecone (vector DB)
  - Multi-stage retrieval: semantic search, BM25, context expansion, re-ranking
- [ ] **Chat Interface**
  - Real-time messaging (user/AI)
  - Message bubbles styled per spec
  - Typing indicator, auto-scroll, timestamps on hover
  - Message history persistence
- [ ] **Document Dashboard**
  - Responsive grid, card hover states, empty state
  - Upload button top-right, search bar, user menu
- [ ] **Bug Analysis**
  - Test all upload, processing, and chat flows for errors (e.g., failed uploads, missing messages)
  - Log and fix backend/API errors

### Exit Criteria
- Users can upload, process, and chat with PDFs end-to-end
- All integrations (UploadThing, MongoDB, Pinecone, Gemini) work reliably
- No critical backend or data bugs

## Phase 3: Enhanced UX, Accessibility & Performance

### Objectives
- Polish user experience, ensure accessibility, and optimize performance.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Advanced Chat Features**
  - Typing indicators, smooth slide-up animations
  - Character/context indicators in input
  - Smooth auto-scroll and input auto-focus
- [ ] **Document Management**
  - Edit, delete, and tag documents
  - Processing status indicators
- [ ] **Responsive Design**
  - Test and optimize for all breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
  - Adaptive navigation (hamburger menu, horizontal bar)
- [ ] **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**
  - Logical tab order, skip links, focus indicators
  - Support for reduced motion, high contrast mode, scalable text
  - Touch targets minimum 44x44px
  - Clear error messages and correction guidance
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize images with Next.js Image component
  - Code splitting, lazy loading, tree shaking
  - Service worker for offline support
  - CDN asset delivery
- [ ] **Bug Analysis**
  - Test for accessibility issues (screen reader, keyboard-only)
  - Profile and fix performance bottlenecks
  - Fix any UI/UX inconsistencies

### Exit Criteria
- App is fully responsive and accessible
- Performance meets Core Web Vitals targets
- No major accessibility or performance bugs

## Phase 4: Testing, Analytics & Deployment

### Objectives
- Ensure reliability, monitor usage, and launch with confidence.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all critical flows
  - Test error states, edge cases, and security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Monitoring & Analytics**
  - Implement UserAnalytics model
  - Track uploads, chat usage, errors, and performance
  - Integrate error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**
  - Beta test with real users, gather feedback
  - Fix all reported bugs and polish UI
- [ ] **Deployment**
  - Set up Vercel deployment with CI/CD
  - Secure environment variables and API keys
  - Final production smoke test
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Update README, deployment, and usage docs
  - Document all environment/configuration requirements
- [ ] **Final Bug Sweep**
  - Run full regression test suite
  - Fix any remaining issues

### Exit Criteria
